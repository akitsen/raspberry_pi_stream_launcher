# Raspberry Pi Stream Launcher

Raspberry Pi based stream launcher for my favorite Youtube channels

Goal of this project is to create an easy to setup and use implementation for quickly launching my favorite Youtube streaming channels.

Inspired by getting my grandma to watch some live streams without the need of her knowing how to use a smart TV interface (she's in her 80's)

Couple of buttons connected to GPIO pins on the RPi that will launch some custom Python scripts.

Trying to make this as easy as possible to use (as my elderly grandparents can't see very well, don't read or speak English and aren't technologically savvy), as well as easy to replicate for others interested in similar setups.
